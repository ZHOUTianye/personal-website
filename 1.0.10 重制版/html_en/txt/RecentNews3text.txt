## Preface

If there were a week-long holiday during the most golden time of the year, and if that holiday allowed you to cast aside all your worries, who could resist an exciting and colorful road trip?


## 01 A Predestined Journey to Shenandoah

This trip itself felt both accidental and inevitable. Back in September, I purchased my very first car. At that time, I was already itching to explore the U.S. while I was still young.

Choosing Shenandoah over other destinations was also both accidental and inevitable. During my senior year of college, my classmate Yuan Ziming shared a Google Earth collection of all the national parks in the U.S. and Canada. Looking at the map of the eastern U.S., I found that national parks were sparse, and only two were relatively close to Pittsburgh, where I study: Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio, about 300 kilometers away, and Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, about 450 kilometers away. While researching, I discovered that Ohio doesn’t allow driving with a Chinese driver’s license, and since I hadn’t obtained a U.S. driver’s license, my only viable option was Shenandoah. Thus, it felt destined that I should go there.

After deciding on my destination, I began independently planning the trip. Here, I’ll share my planning process as a reference for readers who may also need to plan their own trips. If you don’t, feel free to skip this part. First, I studied guides to the park on Xiaohongshu and combined that information with advice from ChatGPT to create a rough itinerary. Then, I examined maps and identified a toll-free route. (I discovered that toll systems vary by state and often involve mailed invoices, which I wanted to avoid.) I also downloaded offline maps of the park to prevent losing my way if cell service was unavailable in the mountains. After sorting these details, I purchased and printed national park passes, specific attraction tickets, a tent, and a sleeping bag. However, I now realize that reserving a campsite should have been my top priority—I underestimated the park’s popularity. When I tried to book a campsite about ten days in advance, I found that all weekend slots were already full, with only a few weekday spots remaining. I quickly secured one, and as expected, within three days, all the weekday slots were gone as well. I was incredibly fortunate!

Next came supplies. My priority was ensuring I wouldn’t go hungry or thirsty, so I bought plenty of bread, instant noodles, and water. Later, I realized this was unnecessary since the park’s facilities, including restaurants, are excellent. Even if you want to prepare your own food, nearby towns offer grocery stores where you can purchase fresh ingredients. Bringing perishables like meat isn’t advisable as they may not keep well.

Since this was my first solo trip, my first road trip, and my first exploration of the U.S., I wasn’t entirely confident. After finalizing my plans, I posted an invitation on social media, hoping to find a travel companion. Unfortunately, I initially managed to recruit only one person, a girl, and with so few people, the trip seemed inconvenient and dull. Eventually, it turned into a completely solo adventure. Though I felt a little disappointed when no one else joined, I quickly turned my thoughts around and grew excited. This meant I could fully embrace the freedom of an independent journey.

## 02 Autumn Scenery: A Journey to the Heart

While researching on Xiaohongshu, I discovered that my fall break coincided with the foliage peak (foliage peak) this year. Seeing the beautiful photos from previous years, I grew eager to experience it for myself. To prepare, I dedicated an hour each day to reviewing basic photography skills and adjusting camera settings, which only heightened my anticipation for the trip.

When the day of departure arrived, the weather wasn’t ideal. The morning was gloomy, and by late morning, light rain began to fall. But this didn’t dampen my spirits. Once I left the city, the roads grew emptier, the views more expansive, and the scenery increasingly beautiful. Driving through dense forests, open valleys, winding mountain roads, and straight highways, my mood only lifted.

Traveling from Pennsylvania to West Virginia, the leaves gradually transitioned from green with faint yellow tints to vibrant gold with splashes of bright red. By the time I reached Virginia, the trees displayed a full palette of colors. Western Virginia’s varied topography, with its range of altitudes, added depth to the autumn hues: green at the base, golden midway up, and crimson near the peaks. Route 48, in particular, offered such colorful scenery that it felt like a dream—a delightful surprise and the highlight of my journey.

The autumn scenery along Route 48 resembled a vivid oil painting. Standing at a scenic overlook, I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply, breathing in the fresh scent of leaves mixed with the crisp mountain air. Across the valley, trees adorned in deep reds, oranges, and yellows shimmered under the sunlight, their leaves gently swaying in the wind. The vibrant canopy stretched like a sea of color, while far below, fallen leaves floated like tiny boats on a creek, drifting slowly downstream. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The tranquility enveloped me; apart from the occasional passing car, only the whispers of nature remained.

This rare sense of peace—being undisturbed and worry-free—was a refreshing experience. Standing at the overlook, I felt a deep connection with the world. Ten minutes passed in what felt like an instant, and I reluctantly left, mindful of my need to reach the campsite before dusk.

Back in the car, I continued along Route 48. Even the small towns along the route seemed to complement the autumn scenery perfectly. Although Halloween was weeks away, many residents had already decorated their front yards with pumpkins and hay bales. Their lawns, blanketed with colorful leaves, radiated a simple yet warm charm. As the mountain fog lifted, the golden valleys appeared even more expansive and majestic. The scenery along this route was so stunning that I drove for five hours without feeling tired at all. Reflecting on it now, I feel grateful I chose this toll-free route; it not only offered unparalleled natural beauty but also fewer cars and a more pleasant drive.



## 03 The Moon as My Companion, the Stars as My Shelter

After a long journey, I finally arrived at Shenandoah National Park. It was close to sunset by the time I reached the park. Seeing that the clouds were starting to disperse, I hurried to a nearby overlook after checking into my campsite. Although the clouds were still thick, I hoped to catch a glimpse of the sunset or some evening colors. Carefully timing my arrival, I made it to the overlook about 30 minutes before sunset.

Unfortunately, the overlook nearest to the campsite didn’t have the best angle. It faced northwest, and there were some nearby hills obstructing the southwest view. After some hesitation, I decided to drive further along the road in search of a better vantage point. However, after 10 minutes of driving, the sun had already set.

I regretted not scouting the nearby overlooks in advance. As I sat in my car berating myself for missing the perfect timing, I noticed the faint purples and reds of the afterglow still lingering on the horizon. Quickly, I jumped out of the car and managed to capture a few photos before the colors faded into the deep blues of dusk. The temperature on the mountain dropped significantly after sunset. Strong, cold gusts of wind pierced through my jacket, forcing me to take turns warming up in the car and stepping out to admire the view. Eventually, as the last traces of light disappeared, I returned to the campsite.

It was almost 8 p.m. by the time I got back. The campsite was pitch black, and even with my camping lamp, I could barely see. Turning on my car’s headlights helped a little, but not much. I attempted to start a fire for cooking and set up my tent, but I had clearly overestimated my abilities. The damp kindling and leaves wouldn’t catch fire despite my efforts with the lighter, let alone the larger logs. Frustrated, I turned my attention to setting up the tent, only to discover that it didn’t come with instructions. The parts scattered on the ground, and with no one to assist me, I abandoned the idea altogether.

After hours of fumbling with no success, I retreated to my car, reclined the seat, and decided to use my phone for entertainment. To my dismay, there was no signal at all. It was barely 9 p.m., and I was already at a loss for how to spend the night. Closing my eyes, I thought about how people in the past managed nights without phones or electricity. Soon enough, I began to feel sleepy. Exhausted from the semester, I let myself drift into a peaceful slumber.

Sometime later, I awoke in the middle of the night, checked my phone, and realized it wasn’t even midnight yet. Normally, I don’t wake up at night, so I guessed the cold had roused me. Adding two layers of clothing, I tried to fall back asleep but couldn’t.

Pulling back the car’s sunroof cover, I was greeted by a stunning view: a clear night sky filled with countless stars, partly veiled by the silhouettes of tree branches. It was the clearest, most brilliant sky I had ever seen.

I stepped out of the car and lay down on an open patch of grass to fully take in the sight. The sky was an endless canvas of deep black, adorned with glittering stars like scattered jewels. The Milky Way stretched across the heavens, its faint, ethereal glow illuminating the mountain peaks below. A waxing moon hung high in the sky, its silvery light soft yet penetrating. Together, the moonlight and starlight created a shimmering veil over the earth, wrapping the mountains in a quiet, magical glow.

However, such beauty was fleeting. Within ten minutes, thin clouds began to drift in from the horizon, gradually covering the moon. The wind picked up, rustling the leaves as if whispering nature’s secrets. Before long, the increasing cloud cover dimmed the view, and the chill became too much to bear. Reluctantly, I returned to the car to sleep.

## 04 A Lone Battle Against Old Rag Mountain

The next morning, I planned to tackle a classic hiking route: Old Rag Mountain. While the mountain is part of Shenandoah National Park, the trailhead isn’t actually located within the park. Instead, it’s in Nethers, about 40 kilometers away. This was something I hadn’t accounted for during my initial research. I had planned to start hiking at 8 a.m., but by the time I reached the trailhead, it was nearly 10 a.m.

Worried about descending the mountain in the dark, I wasted no time. After parking and grabbing my gear, I set off immediately. The first section was a one-kilometer access path connecting the parking lot to the ticket booth. Despite its short distance, this path left me out of breath. Along the way, I encountered a group of women dressed in athletic gear. They were slim but had powerful leg muscles, effortlessly chatting and laughing as they ascended. Initially, I tried to keep up, but within minutes, they were far ahead of me, their pace unrelenting.

By the time I reached the ticket booth, I was already contemplating turning back. “It’s still early,” I thought. “If I give up now, I won’t be too far behind schedule.” However, just as I hesitated, the same group of women emerged from the restroom. One of them noticed my exhausted expression and asked, “Are you feeling good?” Without thinking, I smiled and replied, “Yes.”

With that one word, I committed myself. There was no turning back now. I showed my ticket and began what turned out to be a grueling hike.






The initial part of the trail wasn’t particularly challenging. It was mostly a dirt path with a gentle slope. Feeling energetic and light on my feet, I even found myself humming a tune. I managed to complete the first kilometer in just 14 minutes, thinking to myself, "If I keep this pace, I’ll finish the hike in 4 hours!" The estimated 5-6 hours mentioned online seemed like an overstatement at that moment. However, reality soon hit hard. By the second kilometer, the slope became steeper, and the path muddier. My pace slowed down, and fellow hikers began to overtake me. A sense of unease crept in.

Reaching the third kilometer, the incline grew even more intense, and the trail conditions worsened further. Uneven, jagged rocks were embedded in the dirt path, making it not only tough on my shoes but also painful to step on. I found myself pausing for a break every 100 meters. To make things worse, a light drizzle began to fall, gradually turning into a steady rain. This made the already difficult trek even more challenging. At that point, I couldn’t care less about my muddy shoes—I was more concerned about simply finishing the hike. By the time I completed the first 5 kilometers of uphill slog, I was utterly exhausted, with no energy to appreciate the scenery. The thick trees blocked both the sky above and the ground below, leaving little to admire. Even if the view had been stunning, I wouldn’t have had the strength to enjoy it. I knew I had to push through; lingering too long on the uphill portion would only make the downhill trek rushed and hazardous. So, despite my near-total exhaustion, I pressed on, relying on sheer willpower to continue.

The sixth kilometer turned out to be the most challenging part of the entire hike. This was where I truly experienced the difficulty labeled as "very strenuous" on the official trail map. Looking back now, I can hardly believe I managed to get through it. The trail transformed into a maze of massive, oddly shaped boulders that were taller than a person. If the rest of the trail could be described as a developed scenic route, this section felt like untouched wilderness. The rugged rocks, weathered and jagged, were scattered randomly across the landscape, standing as silent witnesses to the passage of time. Some jutted skyward, while others leaned precariously against the mountainside.

Navigating this rocky terrain was no easy feat. The steep path was littered with loose stones, making every step precarious. In the final stretch, every movement required careful calculation. I had to grip the grooves and edges of rocks tightly, sometimes using protruding stones to climb upward. Each step strained my arms and legs, and my breathing grew increasingly labored. Occasionally, gaps between rocks forced me to stretch or crawl to move forward. Some narrow crevices barely allowed my slim frame to squeeze through, while other sections required me to kneel and slide across the rocks. A few drops between boulders were over two meters high, forcing me to inch down the edges carefully. 

This stretch not only tested my physical stamina but also demanded constant balance and focus. Any misstep could result in a fall or an injury. I stuck close to a group of students ahead of me, mimicking their movements. At one particularly difficult spot, they offered to carry my backpack, allowing me to climb more easily. Thanks to their help, I made slow but steady progress, finally reaching the summit after about an hour.

The view from the top might have been spectacular on a clear day, but the cloudy weather dulled the colors of the landscape. The patchy lighting, with alternating bright and dark areas, made photography challenging. Instead, I focused on the nearby scenery—a vibrant autumn tapestry of trees in fiery red, golden yellow, and lingering green hues. These trees clung stubbornly to the rocky terrain, their roots wedged into crevices, swaying gently in the wind. Falling leaves danced through the air, softening the harshness of the rocky summit.

I found a spot to sit on a boulder, planning to enjoy some bread and water. However, as I rummaged through my bag for the water bottle, I realized it had fallen out during the hike. "No choice," I muttered to myself, swallowing hard to ease my thirst. While I rested, I was approached by a woman from a group I had briefly encountered earlier. She smiled warmly and asked, "Your first time here?" 

"Yes," I replied, still catching my breath but managing a weak smile. 

"You’re great. You did it," she encouraged me. 

Her words brought some comfort, and we began chatting. She was an avid hiker from New York, with plenty of hiking experience, though this was her first time on this trail. I explained that I was a student from Carnegie Mellon. When she asked, "College or high school?" I chuckled inwardly at how little recognition my school seemed to have outside the state. 

Though our conversation was brief, her friendliness left a lasting impression. It reminded me of a warmth and openness that I rarely encountered back home, where fast-paced lifestyles often leave little room for genuine connection. Small talk is dismissed as a nuisance, and casual interactions are often misconstrued. Reflecting on this, I felt a pang of nostalgia for the deeper, more meaningful exchanges that now seemed so rare. 

Snapping out of my thoughts, I noticed the summit had grown eerily quiet. Realizing I had fallen behind the others, I quickly resumed my hike.

The downhill journey should have been easier, but my exhaustion made every step a struggle. By the seventh kilometer, my hip joints began to ache—a dull, unfamiliar pain that gradually intensified. Strangely, my feet and calves, which usually bear the brunt of long hikes, felt fine. Gritting my teeth, I pushed forward, finally reaching the ninth kilometer. The afternoon sun broke through the clouds, casting a golden glow over the trail. 

This was my chance to take out the camera I’d carried all day. I began snapping photos like a person possessed, capturing the dance of falling leaves, the golden hillsides, and the interplay of light and shadow in the forest.

By the tenth kilometer, the trail leveled out. Though the ground was still rocky, it finally felt like a proper path. But with the sun sinking lower, I had to pick up my pace to avoid hiking in the dark. My aching hips protested, but I pressed on, driven by a mix of determination and fear of the unknown lurking in the woods after sunset.

Around the twelfth kilometer, fatigue overtook me completely. My mind went blank, focused solely on putting one foot in front of the other. In hindsight, I later discovered that these last three kilometers were the fastest of my entire hike—a feat likely fueled by sheer desperation to reach the end. 

At last, the parking lot came into view. I stopped my watch and phone timer—7 hours and 12 minutes. Not bad, I thought, given the official trail guide estimated 6-10 hours. But as I looked around the nearly empty parking lot, it became clear that most hikers had finished long before me. I sighed, marveling at their speed, but also felt a surge of pride. Fifteen kilometers through mountainous terrain—a challenge I wouldn’t have dreamed of attempting on flat ground!

Back in the car, I rested for a while before driving back to Shenandoah. That evening, I treated myself to a rare indulgence—a $20 feast of chicken wings. Reflecting on the day’s journey, I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of fulfillment. It was truly a day to remember.

## 05 Battling Wet Leaves and Cold Dew

After another night of rest, I woke up on the third day feeling refreshed and ready for a new adventure. The plan for the day was to explore Dark Hollow Trail and visit a scenic overlook further north, allowing for a more relaxed itinerary to recover from the intensity of the previous day.

Although Dark Hollow Trail is relatively short, at only 3 kilometers round trip, it is rated as "moderate" difficulty due to its steep slopes and narrow paths. The trail is a point-to-point path where the starting point is at the top of the mountain, leading downhill to a waterfall at the base, before requiring hikers to return uphill. The downhill portion was manageable, and my curiosity about the waterfall propelled me forward quickly, leaving little time to admire the scenery along the way.

When I arrived at the waterfall, I realized I had forgotten to bring my tripod, which was essential for capturing the silky, flowing effect in waterfall photography. At first, I thought I would have to improvise by balancing my camera on rocks. But as luck would have it, I noticed a friendly older man with professional camera equipment, including a tripod. I struck up a conversation, complimenting his gear and asking about its cost. As the conversation progressed, I asked if I could borrow his tripod, and to my delight, he agreed. Not only did he lend it to me, but he also helped adjust its angle and position. With his assistance, I quickly captured several photos of the waterfall.

After finishing the photos, I took a break on a nearby rock to enjoy the peaceful surroundings. The waterfall wasn’t very tall—only a few stories high—and its flow was modest in the autumn season. Streams of water cascaded down the rocks, forming a misty spray that reflected sunlight into sparkling droplets. The stream below the waterfall was crystal clear, winding its way over smooth stones while producing a soothing, melodic sound.

I dipped my hand into the icy water. Although it was freezing, the sensation was refreshing and therapeutic. As I lifted a stone from the stream, I noticed leaves trapped beneath it. Placing the leaves gently on the water's surface, I watched as they floated downstream, carried by the gentle current. This simple act reminded me of the “floating cups” tradition I experienced during a visit to the Orchid Pavilion in Shaoxing during high school. Back then, it was wine cups drifting down the stream in a festive atmosphere shared with friends; now, it was solitary leaves in a serene, reflective moment.

The return uphill was challenging. My hips, sore from the previous day’s hike, ached with every step. Along the way, I encountered a few latecomers, including families and photography enthusiasts. Their slower pace gave me the chance to chat briefly, exchanging tips on the best spots to take photos. This trail, I realized, attracted a very different crowd compared to the athletic hikers of Old Rag Mountain.

After lunch, I planned to explore another trail, but strong afternoon winds brought heavy cloud cover, making the weather unpredictable. Coupled with my lingering fatigue, I decided to spend the rest of the afternoon resting at the campsite. I parked my car, reclined the seat, and fell into a deep sleep.



## 06 Busy Transitions

Experience comes from how you perceive the process. This trip taught me invaluable lessons about planning and organizing, especially as I prepared for the second half of the journey, which involved traveling with my classmates. Balancing everyone's preferences and ensuring an enjoyable experience required considerable effort.

On the fourth morning, I left Shenandoah early and drove back to Pittsburgh, arriving around 3 p.m. Barely an hour later, I received a message from my classmates asking me to join them in shopping for camping supplies. At 4 p.m., I found myself at the store, rushing to prepare for our group trip. That evening, I picked up a classmate from the airport, brought them home, and finally returned to my own apartment around 10 p.m. Exhausted, I quickly finalized plans for the next day before collapsing into bed.



## 07 Traveling with Friends

The following morning, I set off with four classmates for Trout Pond Recreation Area. The five of us filled my car perfectly, and the journey was filled with laughter and excitement. Along the way, we passed U.S. Route 48, where I handed the wheel to a friend. He enthusiastically praised the smooth and scenic drive, even hitting 100 miles per hour at one point. Watching them enjoy the experience brought me immense joy.

We arrived at Trout Pond around 3 p.m. and set up our tents and gear. Determined to make the most of the remaining daylight, we embarked on a hike along the pond and lake. The water’s surface was like a giant mirror, reflecting the surrounding mountains and the vibrant autumn leaves. The breeze created gentle ripples, as if whispering the secrets of the forest.

Walking along the lake’s edge, we tread over golden and fiery red leaves, their crunch underfoot adding to the sensory experience. Occasionally, birds chirped in the distance, bringing life to the tranquil surroundings. As the sun set, the sky transformed into a canvas of orange, purple, and red, casting a magical glow over the landscape.

Someone suggested skipping stones on the lake, which turned into an impromptu competition. Though I picked up the skill quickly, my classmates struggled, and we all laughed at their attempts. Later, we tried whistling with blades of grass, enjoying the simple, childlike fun.

As night fell, we gathered around a campfire for a barbecue. The flames danced, casting warm light over the tents and nearby trees. We grilled everything from beef and chicken wings to corn and mushrooms, savoring the smoky aroma and taste. Between bites, we played guessing games and shared stories—some adventurous, some funny. The laughter echoed through the woods, accompanied only by the occasional chirping of insects. When the fire finally burned out, we retired to our tents, content and tired, for a restful night.



## 08 A Satisfying Conclusion

On the final morning, we packed up our gear and began the drive home. The trip officially came to an end, leaving us with lasting memories and a renewed sense of energy.

Reflecting on this journey, I’m proud of how I managed my solo adventure and how I organized the group trip. While some details could have been handled more smoothly, the overall experience exceeded my expectations. Beyond the stunning scenery and camaraderie, I also gained a newfound sense of peace and contentment. Writing this travelogue, I realize how refreshed I felt upon returning from Shenandoah—both in spirit and productivity.

A heartfelt thank-you to my travel companions: Liao Lei, Ma Yixin, Wang Jiayu, and Zhao Haowei (listed alphabetically). Their presence and suggestions greatly enriched the experience. I look forward to our next adventure together.
