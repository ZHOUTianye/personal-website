## Preface
A masterful stroke reveals the landscapes of Guilin, how could one resist such a paradise on earth?  
Guilin, a small city with a booming tourism industry, enters its brief off-season after the Spring Festival when the weather is still perfect for travel. We could not have picked a better time to experience the famous saying "Guilin’s scenery is the finest under heaven" without the crowds.

## Day 1: Xingping Ancient Town
We arrived late at night, a typical “dark and stormy night” scenario, and were immediately approached by local touts, a common scene in smaller towns. Having just come from the bustling metropolis of Hong Kong, I felt a bit uncomfortable, even slightly regretful, worrying about being in an unfamiliar place late at night. Luckily, my friend had arranged for the hotel’s front desk to pick us up, and there were no real safety concerns.  
March in Guilin is that time of year when the weather is warming up but still a bit chilly at night. However, the warmth of the locals more than made up for it. Upon arriving at the hotel, the hostess served us ginger soup with glutinous rice balls, a welcoming gesture that was both thoughtful and heartwarming. We were a bit shy receiving such kind treatment from the middle-aged hosts, and I could tell the hostess was tired, as Guilin's slow pace of life usually means early nights. It occurred to me that she might be going the extra mile for an online review, and I wondered if tourism here was getting as competitive as this.  
Once in the room, I saw they had prepared a platter of fresh fruits, a touch you wouldn’t even find at high-end hotels in big cities. Sitting on the bed, eating the fruits, I was impressed with the first impression Guilin gave me.

Later in the evening, my friend suggested a walk, and I gladly agreed. As soon as we stepped outside the hotel, we heard the sound of flowing water. After walking past a few bamboo groves, we reached the Li River. Coming from the bright city lights, the darkness felt overwhelming, and I couldn’t see a thing. My friend suggested buying some fireworks to light up the surroundings, which I thought was a fun idea, so we spent a few dozen yuan and lit them by the river.

In the glow of the fireworks, we finally saw the outlines of the mountains and water. Guilin’s landscape truly has its own unique charm: the calm water reflected the silhouette of small mountains, enhancing the grandeur of the karst topography. The grey-yellow night sky traced the outlines of the mountains and the riverbanks, and in the distance, fishing boats swayed gently on the river. It was like gazing at a delicate Chinese ink painting in the cool night breeze.  
As we watched the fireworks, memories of a year ago, blowing in the wind by the Pearl River in Guangzhou, came flooding back. It all seemed like it happened just yesterday. We reflected on how fast the four years of university had flown by, how in just two months we’d be going our separate ways, and wondered if, in years to come, we might even become strangers...

## Day 2: Yangshuo 
Back to the main topic. The next morning, we took a boat cruise in the Li River Scenic Area, allowing us to see up close what we had glimpsed in the fireworks' glow the night before. Initially, I was full of enthusiasm, snapping photos everywhere, as the view was truly breathtaking. Light mist gently draped over the mountains, as if cloaking them in a mysterious veil. Each peak appeared and disappeared in the mist, layer upon layer, like a Chinese ink painting that stretched to the horizon. The sky was dim, acting as a calm background, giving the scene a serene and profound atmosphere. The river meandered through the landscape like silk, reflecting faint shadows on its surface. Green foliage was lush, villages were scattered, and one could hear the faint sounds of chickens and dogs. From a distance, fishermen on their boats blended into the scene like the finishing touch of a masterful painting. I kept pressing the shutter, capturing every moment, and even when looking back at the photos later, I found the scenery as captivating as ever.  
Along the way, we also saw the famous scene from the 20-yuan banknote. Unfortunately, the night before, I had meant to take a 20-yuan note with me but completely forgot. By the time I remembered, we were already on the boat, so I had to look up an image online to compare, but it wasn’t quite the same. Lesson learned: for future trips, I must plan better and avoid missing such key details that could affect my excitement!

After the boat tour and lunch, we took a bus to Yangshuo Town. Though technically a county town, just one kilometer outside the town, it felt like we were back in the countryside. Our hotel was located in a village not far from the town center, and I was stunned by the number of hotels in the area. Each hotel was uniquely designed, like works of art. The styles varied from colorful traditional Chinese courtyard homes to rustic, elegant villas with pastoral charm, and the Nordic-style minimalist building we stayed in. These different styles complemented each other well, even when standing side by side. After checking in, we were just in time for the hotel's complimentary afternoon coffee. Since it was free, we couldn’t pass it up and went to the second-floor café for a short break.  
Sitting amidst the beautiful landscape, listening to classical European music while sipping authentic coffee was a new and unforgettable experience. By the second day, the stress and tension of city life had completely dissipated, replaced by a deep sense of relaxation. With every sip of coffee, I felt time slow down. It reminded me of the carefree days of my childhood, where I would sit quietly, savoring an entire afternoon without a worry in the world, like during that long summer vacation in sixth grade. Now, after all these years of living in a constant rush, I realized I had forgotten how to simply be in the moment, to savor the taste of good food, to breathe in fresh air, and to acknowledge my tiredness. Closing my eyes, I thought about how soon we’d return to our busy lives and how fleeting this precious moment was, and I felt tears welling up. I couldn’t let my friend see me cry, so I blinked them away and took a few deep breaths, telling my friend I was just tired while silently scolding myself for being so sentimental.

## Day 3: Yulong River, Ruyi Peak & West Street
The highlight of our trip came on the third day. After breakfast, we went bamboo rafting on the Yulong River. Unlike the previous day’s boat tour, bamboo rafting was more expensive and less commercialized—no 20-yuan photo service or other gimmicks—making it a more immersive experience of Guilin’s natural beauty. The raft was small, about the width of two benches and the length of four legs—a very accurate estimate, as stretching out your arms and legs would allow you to touch the water. This gave me the feeling that I was almost floating on the water. Unlike larger boats, the open view from the bamboo raft allowed me to fully appreciate the scenery. When drifting across the wide sections of the river, the water seemed to merge with the distant mountains, making me feel small and insignificant. In the narrower sections, lush bamboo groves formed a canopy overhead, their leaves swaying gently in the breeze, filling the air with a soft rustling sound. It was just like the peaceful, solitary scene described in Liu Zongyuan’s *A Small Stone Pool*: “Sitting at the pool, surrounded by bamboo and trees, in a desolate place with no one around, the eerie stillness chills the bones and stirs deep sorrow.”  
The raft master told us we had come at just the right time. In peak season, the river is packed with bamboo rafts, and the long wait times and overcrowding ruin the experience. I couldn’t help but marvel at my friend’s impeccable planning and our incredible luck.

After a short break in the afternoon, we headed to the next destination—Ruyi Peak. As it’s a bit off the beaten path, Ruyi Peak isn’t a popular attraction, so my expectations were low. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The scenery was beautiful, and there weren’t many people, which made the experience even better. Riding the cable car up the mountain, I was struck by the towering karst formations rising abruptly from the flat ground. The flatter the terrain, the steeper the mountains seemed. The cable car ingeniously took advantage of the high peaks, with each support tower perched on the mountain itself. As we discussed the safety of the cable car system, given the unstable nature of karst formations, we reminisced about our harrowing cable car ride during a thunderstorm at Wugong Mountain. Compared to that, this felt much safer.

Once at the top, Ruyi Peak felt like a different world, with three distinctive attractions making the trip unforgettable. First, the suspension bridge, swaying gently in the wind between two peaks, with steep cliffs on either side and a deep gorge below. The challenge of walking across the bridge inspired a sense of awe. Due to the peak's auspicious name, many visitors tied red ribbons along the bridge’s railings, praying for safety and good fortune. The fluttering ribbons added a touch of warmth and hope to the otherwise imposing landscape. Next, we reached the observation deck at the summit. From there, we could see the highway snaking like a silver thread through the mountains, with the majestic range stretching into the distance. There was no water here, but the scenery was still impressive, evoking a sense of nature’s grandeur. Red ribbons adorned this area as well, with visitors leaving behind their wishes for a smooth and prosperous journey in life. Finally, we walked along the glass walkway, suspended over a sheer drop, giving us the feeling of floating in midair. The stunning karst peaks and blue sky seemed almost within reach. Each step was a blend of thrill and awe, leaving a lasting impression—truly the perfect end to our journey.

However, no trip is without its downsides. As we descended the mountain, a noisy group of jewelry vendors (likely scammers) soured the mood slightly. Even in 2024, some rural tourist spots still lack proper management.

That evening, we visited West Street, which was lit up brightly with a bustling night market atmosphere, resembling the lively commercial streets of major cities. Neon signs flashed, and the streets were filled with the sounds of vendors calling out, people chatting, and the clatter of feet. The variety of food stalls, barbecue stands, bubble tea shops, and other street foods created a feast for the senses. I bought lots of local handmade sweets to take home as souvenirs to remind me of Guilin's sweetness.  
However, as I walked through this so-called “food street,” I couldn’t help but feel that it lacked the unique charm of a small town. The food was delicious, but it could have been anywhere in any modern city. The barbecue, bubble tea, and fried chicken were no different from those found in cities across China, and there was little trace of the local culture or tradition. The street seemed dominated by commercialization, with Guilin’s natural beauty and cultural heritage feeling somewhat sidelined. As night fell, standing at the end of West Street by the banks of the Li River, I watched the crowds of tourists coming and going and felt a sense of reluctance. I knew that tomorrow we would be leaving this city, and while I felt content, I also couldn’t shake a sense of nostalgia for the unique tranquility and nature we had experienced.  
This was my last night in Guilin, and as I reflected on this trip, the last one I would take as a university student departing from Hong Kong, I knew that Guilin would always hold a special place in my heart.
