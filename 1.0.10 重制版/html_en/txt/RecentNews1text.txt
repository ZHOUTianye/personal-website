After four years of tireless effort during my university studies, in March 2024, I finally completed all of my school applications. To my astonishment, I received offers from several prestigious institutions across the ocean. These recognitions were achievements I never dared to dream of. Along this journey, there were so many lucky breaks and coincidences. Here, I want to express my gratitude to all the family members, classmates, and teachers who helped me along the way. Your support and advice were like guiding lights, illuminating my path during countless long nights of academic pursuit.

In this article, I will reflect on the past four years, evaluating both the right and wrong decisions I’ve made. I hope the right decisions can elicit a smile of indifference from you, and the mistakes I made can serve as a lesson learned. A special reminder: I firmly believe we should live in the present, and past experiences should serve to add value to our future decisions. Thus, I will only list those past decisions that are relevant to my future choices. Any decisions made without thought—whether right or wrong—will not be reflected on here, as they are not worth reconsidering.

## 1 Wrong Decision–Pushing Through Inefficient Learning Environments

### I should have studied in environments conducive to learning.  
In my first semester, I suffered from poor learning conditions. I can still vividly remember my awful study sessions at home due to safety concerns that kept me away from campus—this was my biggest mistake. Later, when I chose to study in dark, cold, and damp libraries, my hands and feet would freeze, making it impossible to concentrate. This isn't nitpicking; even if my mind was clear, I couldn't hold a pen with frozen hands, so how could my efficiency be high?

For the future, efficiency should always come first. Inefficiency can trigger a vicious cycle of self-blame. Therefore, the environment that determines your efficiency must also be prioritized. Whenever I need to study, I must be in a comfortable, optimal learning environment.  
Here are my personal preferences:  
- In Beijing: In winter, study in the living room or a well-lit library. In summer, study in the east-side bedroom.  
- In Dezhou: The house is not conducive to studying year-round due to the negative influence of my parents.  
If I must study at home in the future, I need to invest in improving the environment to make it conducive to focused learning.

## 2 Wrong Decision–Hesitation in Sophomore Year Without Clear Direction

### I should have found my interest or career path earlier.  
Whether it's energy/environmental chemistry, computer science, research, or employment, I should have planned and prepared earlier. The sooner I focused my energy on the right path, the better. Skills, in essence, are never too many; even if I don't use them in the future, I wouldn't regret having them.

This same principle applies to the future: invest time in researching job requirements for target positions and devote significant effort to them. This is the correct path.

## 3 Correct Decision but Not to Be Emulated–Relying on Classmates

### In graduate school, I should focus on personal growth.  
During my undergrad, when coursework became increasingly challenging, teaming up with classmates to maintain a steady GPA was a reasonable approach. I still vividly remember the help I received from classmates in tough courses like MA 2181 and SEE 3101. Without these efforts to keep my GPA stable, I would not have received the offers I did. However, moving forward, it's essential not to rely on others.

GPA is no longer a key evaluation criterion for employment; what matters now is actual competence. Therefore, the focus should shift to learning what I truly want and what society demands, without the ulterior motive of maintaining grades. The GPA of my undergrad served merely as a way to demonstrate my ability to others. Exam-oriented learning was a compromise I had to make during the application phase, but in graduate school, the time and energy spent should be focused on personal development.

Prioritization of effort in graduate school:
1. Personal skill development (learning inside and outside the classroom, internships)  
2. Personal well-being (fitness, hobbies)  
3. Any courses I’m less interested in.

All of this can be achieved without relying on others.

## 4 A Not Entirely Correct Decision–Listening to Others' Advice While Trusting My Own Judgment

In an information bubble, I should always seek diverse perspectives.  
When faced with advice from others, I should always question it and examine the reasons behind it. It's crucial to assist my decision-making by determining whether others' advice is based on undeniable facts. During the school application process, if someone couldn't provide clear reasons for their recommendation, their advice should not count as valid input. Votes from online polls should be taken lightly unless there’s a clear majority; otherwise, the data is irrelevant.

I am grateful that I retained the final say in decision-making, but my research could have started earlier, as it influenced my judgment when listening to others' early advice.

## 5 Half-Right, Half-Wrong Decision–Avoidance Doesn’t Solve Problems

From May to July 2023, the prime period for preparing for the IELTS exam, I wasted too much time and endured a painful preparation process. This was mainly due to a poor living environment where I couldn't sleep well. How could I study efficiently if I wasn't getting good sleep?

In May and June, I considered leaving Hong Kong for Beijing, but I stayed because I thought I’d be less distracted by family in Hong Kong. But I didn't expect my efficiency to drop drastically after July 15 th. It was a mistake to remain in an unproductive state for so long.

Luckily, at the end of July, I decided to return to Beijing, which improved my sleep quality and boosted my study efficiency. Had I not done so, I would have wasted the entire summer.

## 6 Correct but Improvable Decision–Continuing to Learn Independently

I’m glad I stuck to independent learning, even though my time was mostly spent preparing applications after completing CS 2204. As you can see, the results of not giving up are evident. While I’m not yet an expert in front-end development, I’ve made significant progress beyond a beginner's level.

For the future, maintaining curiosity and a passion for exploration is important, but it's more crucial to avoid getting distracted. Keep learning with quality and depth, and make sure it’s application-driven.  
Before starting a new project, think carefully: can I tackle the challenges on my own? Is it worth the time?

## 7 Decision That Wasn’t Wrong but Needs Improvement–Fear of Showing Myself

This boils down to a fear of competition. The deep-rooted issue of insecurity has caused many related problems. These include avoiding eye contact in high-pressure conversations, always acknowledging my own faults before pointing out others’ mistakes, and hesitating to ask competent people for reasonable requests.

I was afraid to show my true self because I feared my efforts would attract too much attention. This self-imposed limitation only served to hold me back.  
For graduate school, I need to work on showing confidence, managing interpersonal dynamics, and striking a balance between expressing myself and being strategic.

## 8 Correct Decision – Abandon Quantitative Management Used from 2021

Initially, tracking screen time or study hours worked well to control my behavior. As my self-discipline was weaker at the time, these methods helped me spend more time studying. However, as the difficulty of my studies increased, tracking time no longer accurately reflected my learning progress.

By gradually realizing that task completion is more important than time spent, I was able to increase my efficiency significantly. The Pomodoro technique became more of a supplementary tool, useful on occasion but less effective when coursework pressure was high.

The key takeaway is this: multitasking can work for less important tasks, but for major tasks, it's critical to finish one before starting another.

## 9 Correct but Improvable Decision–Work and Rest Properly for Efficiency

This has always been my goal in life. I aim to achieve comprehensive development in all areas: intellectual, physical, artistic, and manual. Although the pressure of life has made it difficult to achieve this ideal, I hope to maintain a high quality of rest to boost my energy and improve my social interactions and productivity.

## Conclusion & Appendix
I don't know the endpoint of my academic journey, nor do I know how I’ll reach it. But that's exactly why I chose to embark on it in the first place. At the time, I had no other options but to bet on my perseverance and determination. Now, with so many more resources and opportunities, I will confidently and steadfastly continue this journey, no matter how uncertain the road ahead may be.


Here are the results of all my graduate school applications for Fall 2024.


 Final Choice:
- Carnegie Mellon University – Civil and Environmental Engineering (Feb 12)

 Accepted (In order of preference):
- Columbia University – Earth and Environmental Engineering (Mar 15)
- Northwestern University – Project Management (Feb 26)
- Johns Hopkins University – Geography and Environmental Engineering (Feb 8)

According to rankings and majors, most of the schools I applied to belong to the second tier of schools in the United States. Schools like CMU, Columbia, Northwestern, and Hopkins have very little difference in terms of academic standing. In fact, going to any one of these institutions would be a great advantage. After consulting multiple sources and conducting thorough research, I made my final decision. This choice might not be the absolute best, but it is certainly one of the top three most correct decisions I could have made, and I will not regret it.

As the saying goes, "Take it as it comes, enjoy it as it comes." The moment I set foot in CMU, the game begins. The moguls of CMU are about to start a high-stakes gamble. All my chips are on the table, and without a doubt, this will be an exciting game. I humbly ask for your guidance and support as I embark on this journey.
